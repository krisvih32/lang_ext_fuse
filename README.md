##call
###Calling
you can call a full file or a specific function from a file like this:<br>
call path path_type full function ( optional )<br>
###Examples
call /Users/Andrew/programs/test.c *nix false example_func<br>
this line would execute the function example_func from the *nix path "/Users/Andrew/programs/test.c"<br>
call c:\Users\Andrew\Desktop\test.c drive true<br>
the "drive true" path might seem confusing, but it's just a type of file path most commonly used on windows<br>
