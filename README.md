Use different snippets from c, go, and python.
you can call a full file or a specific function from a file like this:
call path path_type full function ( optional ) for example
call /Users/Andrew/programs/test.c *nix false example_func
this line would execute the function example_func from the *nix path "/Users/Andrew/programs/test.c"
here's another example
call c:\Users\Andrew\Desktop\test.c drive true

here are all of the	path types you can use
